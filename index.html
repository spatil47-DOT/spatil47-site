        		<h1>Hello, I'm Suraj Patil.</h1>
	<p> I formulated the approach for adoption of Artificial-Intelligence for the traditional manufacturing setup and I am passionate to work on crucial data analytics projects.
	 In my current role at Indifour Consult Pvt. Ltd., I am heading the data science department and I've pioneered a data leverage framework, shaping impactful data strategies for organizations.
	My core skill sets involve Gen AI, deep learning model making and adaptive systems solution development. 
		
		I am also a PhD research scholar at Department of Technology, Savitribai Phule Pune University, Pune, India. My research interests are in the 
	fields of Biometrics, Signal Processing, Computer Vision and Financial Analysis. I am actively pursuing developmental projects with concrete 
	research components which can be made into production in an end to end fashion using deep learning models, Hybrid Mobile App frameworks like Flutter and 
				Serverless architectures.

		<b>Jul 2014 - Jun 2015</b>	|	Master's Student, SPPU	<br> 
        <b>Master's Thesis:</b> Robust adaptive beam-forming for general-rank signal model with positive semi-definite (PSD) constraint for optimal solution<br>
	We propose a two step closed form solution of the formulated robust adaptive beamforming problem, 
	wherein a new single variable minimization problem is constructed. Result of this minimization is used to solve the robust adaptive beamforming problem. 
Using Lagrange’s Multiplier Method, a closed form solution for the robust adaptive beam-forming problem was achieved. 
		Simulation results verify the improvement in the performance by the proposed method over the current robust adaptive beamforming methods for general-rank signal model.<br>
